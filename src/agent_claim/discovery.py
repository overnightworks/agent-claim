    Every bootstrapped ledger is labelled `LEDGER_LABEL` (`_ensure_ledger_labels`
    attaches it, and `reconcile` backfills it onto an older, unlabelled ledger —
    see `protocol.reconcile_all_labels`), and only the canonical ledger ever
    carries it. Asking for that exact label is genuinely atomic under normal
    operation: the answer is at most one issue, always one response, one
    snapshot — never a fetch spanning multiple page requests that a
    concurrent open/close could shift an issue across.

    Only when the labelled query comes back empty — an unlabelled legacy
    ledger, or a genuine absence — does discovery fall back to scanning every
    open issue. That scan can only report absence (return `None`) when the
    listing's own `pages_fetched` says it was one snapshot; the adapter owns
    what "one page" means for its provider, so this reads only that
    provenance, never a duplicated page-size constant. A fallback the
    listing itself reports as spanning more than one page can never prove
    absence, no matter how the counts line up — an issue that closed on an
    already-consumed page while another opened could leave the item count
    exactly equal to the live open-issue count while still hiding an
    unlabelled legacy ledger that shifted across the page boundary — so that
    case always fails loud instead. Within a listing the adapter reports as
    one page, the open-issue-count comparison is still worth keeping as an
    additional detector: it cannot involve a page-boundary shift, but the
    count itself comes from a separate request that could still have raced
    an open or close between the two calls. Whichever check trips, this must
    fail loud rather than report "no ledger" — reporting that wrongly
    invites `bootstrap`, which would create a second, competing ledger next
    to one that still exists.
