"""The forge port: repository identity, typed failures, and the read/write surface.

`ForgeReader`/`ForgeWriter` are the provider-neutral contract every adapter
(today: GitHub) implements; `ForgeOperation` names every operation on that
contract and `Capability` answers, per operation, whether an adapter can
perform it at all. Nothing in this module or its callers branches on that
answer yet -- the GitHub adapter never refuses an operation -- so the first
real consumer is #112 (item kind as the native issue type; decision record
0001 ruling D3 maps kind read-only on GitLab Free, which cannot create a
custom `Container` type).
